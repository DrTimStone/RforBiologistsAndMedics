# RforBiologistsAndMedics

This is a very gentle introduction into R Programming intended for people that had a reluctance to use R because of the command line environment.

People (biologists and medics) who are unfamiliar with R are a vanishing breed, and less likely to need an introduction at this basic level but it was useful to encourage those relucatnt people that prefereed SPSS or Excel to try a bit of command-line programming.
